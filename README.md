# Htm.elle Demo Site

A demo site for the htm.elle program. At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to
create a similar site.

## About the site

The site design is responsive for mobile sizes up to desktop sizes. It also features a few dynamic
elements, implemented using CSS tricks or trivial amounts of JavaScript. Leaving it to you to tinker
with the UI with some mouse hovers and clicks. Shrink the width of your browser window to view the
site through a mobile POV as well.
